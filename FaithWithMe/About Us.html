    <p>     Founded in 2008, The South African Muslim Charitable Trust (SAMCT) emerged with a distinct mission — to serve as a pivotal conduit for channeling funding assets, vital services, and resources to approved public benefit organizations. From its inception, SAMCT has been unwavering in its commitment to catalysing positive change and making a lasting impact on communities.
        
        Since its establishment, SAMCT has played a transformative role by directing substantial donations towards multifaceted initiatives. These initiatives span across poverty alleviation, empowerment, community upliftment, and sustainability programs. SAMCT’s journey is marked by a dedicated pursuit of fostering social equity and enhancing the well-being of those in need.
       
        Driven by the core belief that ‘Charity Begins At Home,’ SAMCT stands as a beacon of compassion and a catalyst for meaningful philanthropy. The Trust continues to evolve, responding dynamically to the evolving needs of society, and remains steadfast in its dedication to creating a more equitable and empowered South Africa.

Matthew 6:2-4
“Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Read More

Hypocrites originally referred to Greek actors who wore different masks to play various roles. Jesus criticizes the religious leaders, most notably the Pharisees, for a particular form of hypocrisy: doing right things for the wrong reasons. To give to the needy was one of the pillars of piety, but the religious leaders gave to the needy in order to be praised by others. The tragic irony was that they had received their reward of public and professional acclaim, but that was all the reward they would ever receive, and such fleeting human adulation precludes satisfaction of the deep longing of people’s hearts to stand approved by their Father who sees in secret.
